used c++ cause easier to find location in file and edit

had to change gloabl variable fo fin to put in =method because it wouldnt process multiople values at once

edit_Inventory uses pass by parameters so im passing the whole thing in, had an issue with it not working earlier so i tried a few things and this worked

was going to run error check in method, but figured easier to do it in case statment for edit edit_Inventory\


    //need a check for black badges and magic carpets boolean values so swtich statment ? i guess ? 

// cout << "You want to edit which stat? Type hp, mhp, exp, gold" << endl;
  //  cin >> stat_input;
  //  transform(stat_input.begin(), stat_input.end(), stat_input.begin(), ::tolower);

  fin.close to save data otherwise wont write lol

    When I was doing this project or, thinking about how to do it, I initially wanted to use Java,
    the language I am most comfortable in. But then I saw that I had to read in the whole file, and 
    then edit it from there but I did not want to do that. Then I found that in C++ I can find the
    location of certain things I wanted to edit and edit them from there using pointers, so I decided
    on C++. I also had to change my file in from being a global variable to putting them into the method
    then closing after the method is finished so the data that gets altered is stored. The first time I 
    tried running the program the method did not save the editted information so I had to find another way
    to open and close and decided ultimately to call file in inside the methods. 

    I actually found online the offsets for each characters and their abilities. But I did double check
    whether the information I found online matches each character. I noticed a pattern when I was looking
    through the information in the HEX editor. For example, the stats for another character would be in a
    multipe of 0x20. Shamino's stats are 0x20 away from the players and so forth. 

    I gave the user the ability to edit certain character's stats and their respective inventories.
    In my save file, I have changed the stats of each of the three characters the player starts
    off with to their maxed values, and also maxed the inventories. The user of the program however,
    may edit this information themselves if they wish to. The end results was maxed stats for player,
    Shamino, and Iolo, and their inventories maxed as well. 

    I found this project to be one of the more interesting, if not, the most interesting
    project in my CECS career here. I have always been interested in hacking games and 
    editting their values and this project allowed me to learn more about that.
